# incremental-counter

A basic incremental and decremental counter.

I built this counter by myself without the use of any tutorials, just a bunch of research and troubleshooting. This incremental counter allows the user to count up and down, reset the display, save a number in local storage and then load that value at any time. When a value is loaded, the user can continue incrementing from that same value.
